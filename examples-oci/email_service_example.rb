# This script provides a basic example of how to use the Email Delivery service in the Ruby SDK.
#
# This will use credentials and settings from the DEFAULT profile at ~/.oci/config (on windows
# "C:\Users\{user}\.oci\config"), however if that file does not exist we will automatically fall back to using
# ~/.oraclebmc/config (on windows "C:\Users\{user}\.oraclebmc\config")
#
# The script will demonstrate:
#
#     * Creating, retrieving, listing and deleting email senders
#     * Creating, retrieving, listing and deleting email suppressions
#     * Obtaining SMTP credentials for your IAM user so that you can send emails.
#       See https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Email/Tasks/configuresmtpconnection.htm for more
#       information on sending emails
#
# Note that email senders are created in the compartment which you specify, but the suppressions are always created at the tenancy
# level. The tenancy will be read from your configuration file
#
# Format:
#   email_service_example.rb <compartment ID> <sender email> <suppression email>
#
# Example run:
#   ruby examples/email_service_example.rb 'ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaac4xqx43texeuonfionxsx4okzfsya5evr2goe2t7v5wntztaymab' sender@rubysdkexample.com suppression@rubysdkexample.com
