# This script provides a basic example of how to use archive storage in the Object Storage service. This example
# will create an archive storage bucket and demonstrate putting and restoring objects.
#
# The example will use credentials and settings from the DEFAULT profile at ~/.oci/config (on windows
# "C:\Users\{user}\.oci\config"), however if that file does not exist we will automatically fall back to using
# ~/.oraclebmc/config (on windows "C:\Users\{user}\.oraclebmc\config")
#
# Format:
#   object_storage_archive_example.rb <compartmend ID> <bucket name>
