# This script demonstrates how to use the UploadManager to upload objects to Object Storage. We'll see how
# the UploadManager can be used to upload objects in multiple parts, as well as doing a single-part upload
# (uploading the entire object at once).
#
# This will use credentials and settings from the DEFAULT profile at ~/.oci/config (on windows
# "C:\Users\{user}\.oci\config"), however if that file does not exist we will automatically fall back to using
# ~/.oraclebmc/config (on windows "C:\Users\{user}\.oraclebmc\config")
#
# Format:
#   upload_manager.rb <bucket name>
#
# Example run:
#   ruby upload_manager.rb 'upload_manager_test_bucket'

# The most basic UploadManager - we supply the client used to talk to Object Storage but use the default configuration.
# Under this default configuration, we'll only upload objects with a size of 128 MiB (128 * 1024 * 1024 bytes) or more
# in multiple parts. Anything smaller will be done as a single-part upload.

# UploadManager can also resume previous partial uploads. As a naive example to demonstrate this, we'll upload

# In a more real-world scenario, if you use UploadManager's upload() method and it doesn't complete successfully
# but some parts were uploaded, you could then call resume() with the relevant upload_id to try and finish
# the multipart upload by uploading only the remaining parts
