# This script demonstrates using the ObjectStorageClient to upload, retrieve, delete and apply metadata to objects.
# This script expects as parameters the bucket where the object operations will be done and the name of target object.
# The bucket must exist prior to the script being run (the script will not create the bucket).
#
# For uploading objects, you should consider using the UploadManager (see the upload_manager.rb and upload_manager_stdin.rb examples) rather
# than the put_object operation directly as UploadManager automatically handles large files ("large" is a configurable value) by breaking
# them into multiple parts and uploading them in parallel. By contrast, the put_object operation will attempt to upload any provided data
# in one go.
#
# This script will use credentials and settings from the DEFAULT profile at ~/.oci/config (on windows
# "C:\Users\{user}\.oci\config"), however if that file does not exist we will automatically fall back to using
# ~/.oraclebmc/config (on windows "C:\Users\{user}\.oraclebmc\config")
#
# Format:
#   object_crud_and_metadata_example.rb <bucket name> <object name>
#
# Example run:
#   ruby object_crud_and_metadata_example.rb 'object_crud_test_bucket'
